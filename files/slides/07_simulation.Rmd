# Why simulate? 

* In science, how do we support or refute a hypothesis? 

--

* We run an experiment! 

--

* Experiments let us work in a setting where we have precise control

---

# Simulation 

* Often we don't have the resources to run an experiment 

--

* Instead, we can run a simulation 

--

* Simulation: Computer experiment that involves creating data by pseudo-random sampling 

---

# Why do we simulate? 

* We have some statistical problem that we don't know how to answer analytically or want to check our answer for

--

  + What is the probability of flipping $5$ coins and getting all heads? 
  
--

* We want to evaluate the performance of a statistical method 

--

  + If our observations are not independent from each other, does a t test for the mean still work? 
  
--

  + For a given $H_0$ and $H_a$, what is the relationship between Type I and Type II error? 

---

# Example: flipping coins 

What is the probability of flipping $5$ coins and getting all heads? 

```{r}
0.5^(5)
```

---

# Example: flipping coins 

What is the probability of flipping $5$ coins and getting all heads?

```{r}
coins <- rbinom(n = 100000, size = 5, prob = 0.5)
mean(coins == 5)
```

---

# Example: variance of the sample mean

For a set of random variables $X_1,\ldots,X_n$, each independent with variance $\sigma^2$, what is the variance of the sample mean? 

\begin{align*}
Var(\bar{X}) &= Var(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i) \\
&= \frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i=1}^n Var(X_i) \\
&= \frac{n\sigma^2}{n^2} \\
&= \frac{\sigma^2}{n}
\end{align*}

---

# Example: variance of the sample mean

For a set of random variables $X_1,\ldots,X_n$, each independent with variance $\sigma^2$, what is the variance of the sample mean? 

```{r}
data1 <- rexp(10, rate = 1)
mean(data1)
data2 <- rexp(100, rate = 1)
mean(data2)
data3 <- rexp(1000, rate = 1)
mean(data3)
```

---

# Example: variance of the sample mean

We need to randomly generate data many times to answer our question

```{r}
n_sim <- 10000
result_matrix <- matrix(nrow = n_sim, ncol = 3)
for (i_sim in 1:n_sim) {
  result_matrix[i_sim, 1] <- mean(rexp(10, rate = 1))
  result_matrix[i_sim, 2] <- mean(rexp(100, rate = 1))
  result_matrix[i_sim, 3] <- mean(rexp(1000, rate = 1))
}
var(result_matrix[, 1])
var(result_matrix[, 2])
var(result_matrix[, 3])
```

# Psuedocode 

* Psuedocode: writing out the steps of an algorithm 

--

* Useful in general for programming, but especially when designing a simulation study 

---

# Psuedocode 

## Example: flipping coins

Goal: find probability of getting $5$ heads in $5$ coin flips 

* make result vector to hold number of heads for $100000$ trials 
* for $100000$ trials, do the following: 
  + Flip $5$ coins 
  + Count and record the number of heads 
* Report the proportion of trials that had $5$ heads 

---

# Psuedocode 

## Example: variance of sample mean 

Goal: find variance of sample mean 

* set sample sizes to be $10$, $100$, and $1000$ 
* make result matrix to hold sample means for $10000$ trials, for each sample size 
* for $10000$ trials, do the following: 
  + Generate $10$ independent and identically distributed observations and calculate mean 
  + Generate $100$ independent and identically distributed observations and calculate mean 
  + Generate $1000$ independent and identically distributed observations and calculate mean 
* Calculate variance of means from $10$ observations 
* Calculate variance of means from $100$ observations 
* Calculate variance of means from $1000$ observations 

---

# Write a function 

* It is often helpful to write a function that will generate data and do any required calculations for a single trial 

---

# Write a function 

## Example: flipping coins

```{r}
flip_coins_once <- function() {
  coins <- rbinom(n = 1, size = 5, prob = 0.5)
  return(mean(coins == 5))
}
```

---

# Write a function 

## Example: variance of sample mean 

```{r}
generate_data_once <- function(n) {
  data <- rexp(10, rate = 1)
  return(mean(data))
}
```

---

# Test function 

* Often we will run a simulation with a large number of trials 

--

* Sometimes this will take a long time 

--

* It's always safest to first test with a small number of trials 

---

# Report results

# Live coding example 

Study the relationship between expected and observed variance for draws from a binomial distribution with sample sizes $n=10$ and $n=1000$. Consider the binomial distribution with $5$ trials and probabilities $p$ in the set $\{0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8\}$.
