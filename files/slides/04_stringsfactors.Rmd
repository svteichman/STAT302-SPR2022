# Strings

## What are strings?

A **character** is a symbol from a written language, such as a letter, a numeric, a symbol, or otherwise. A **string** is a collection of characters grouped together (such as a word).

Even when we do quantitative work, lots of important and interesting data often comes in the form of strings, and knowing how to work with them is essential for data scientists and statisticians.

.sectionhead[Part 2. Factors]

---

.middler[<img src="images/forcats.png" alt="" height="350"/>]

# Factors 

**factors** are categorical data that use integer representation.

This can be efficient to store character vectors, because each string is only entered once. 
Because of this, creating data frames (but not tibbles!) in R often default to set strings as factors.

# Movies data

```{r}
f_small_1 <- factor(c("b", "a"), levels = c("a", "b"))
f_small_2 <- factor(c("a", "c"), levels = c("a", "c"))
fct_c(f_small_1, f_small_2)
```
Compare to
```{r}
c(f_small_1, f_small_2)
```

.sectionhead[Part 3: Dates and Times]

# New package alert! Lubridate

```{r}

# Consider release dates for movies

```{r}

# Parsing Date-times

---

**Dates** and **date-times** are special classes of objects in R.
`lubridate` does a fantastic job of taking a variety of input and converting them into standardized format using for dates:
* **y** for year
* **m** for month
* **d** for day
* **q** for quarter

and for times:
* **h** for hour
* **m** for minute
* **s** for second

You can combine these into more functions and inputs than we are able to show, but we'll go through several examples.

---

Strings in any ordering can be changed into objects of the "Date" type.


```{r}
mdy("01-29-2020")
dmy("29-01-2020")
ydm("2020-29-01")
```

---

It accepts a variety of input formats.

```{r}
mdy("Jan 29, 2020")
dmy("29th of January, 2020")
mdy("01/29/20")
```

---


```{r}
head(movies$release_date)
```

--



```{r}
head(mdy(movies$release_date))
```

---
We can add times, and even quarters.

```{r}
yq("2020: Q1")
yq("2020 Quarter 1")
dmy_h("29 Jan 2020 at 2pm")
mdy_hms("Jan 29th 2020, 4:10:43")
```

# Extracting Date-time Components

---

When we have an object in date-time form, we can easily extract information.

```{r}
x <- ymd_hms("2020-01-29, 3:29:59 pm", tz = "US/Pacific")
x
year(x)
month(x)
day(x)
```

---
```{r}
head(mdy(movies$release_date))
```
--
```{r}
head(year(mdy(movies$release_date)))
```
---


```{r}
hour(x)
minute(x)
second(x)
tz(x)
```

---

```{r}
wday(x) # day of week
wday(x, label = TRUE)
week(x) # week of year
quarter(x) # quarter of year
```

---


We can also edit date-time objects.

```{r}
x
hour(x) <- 13
year(x) <- 2021
x
```

---
layout: false

# Tell R when you have date-times!

When working with date-time data, it is important that you tell R you are working with date-times using `lubridate`! If you do not, you may get an error that looks like this:

```{r, error = TRUE}
x <- "01/29/2020"
day(x)
y <- mdy(x)
day(y)
```

---

# Movies data set 

Which days of the week do you think have the most movie releases?

Can we plot the number of movies in our dataset that were released on each day of the week?

movies_day_week <- movies %>%
  mutate(day_week = wday(mdy(release_date), label = TRUE))
ggplot(movies_day_week, aes(x = day_week)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  xlab("Day of the week") + ylab("Count") + 
  ggtitle("Number of movies released by day of week") + 
  theme_bw(base_size = 16) + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

---

# Movies data set 

```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}

  xlab("Day of the week") + ylab("Count") + 
  ggtitle("Number of movies released by day of week") +
