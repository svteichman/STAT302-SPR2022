Study the relationship between expected and observed variance for draws from a binomial distribution with sample sizes $n=10$ and $n=1000$. Consider the binomial distribution with $5$ trials and probabilities $p$ in the set $\{0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8\}$. 

```{r}
# set nsim 

# write function to draw data and calculate variance once 

# create sample sizes vector 

# create probabilities vector 

# create matrix to hold results 

# run simulation 

# calculate results 

# plot results 

```
